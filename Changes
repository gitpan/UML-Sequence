Revision history for Perl extension UML::Sequence.

0.05  Tue Sep 30 13:50:54 CDT 2003
      Corrected NAME entry in pod for genericseq.source so that html links
      on CPAN are not broken for it.
      Corrected t/03java.t to reflect the new instance oriented approach
      (boxes at the top of the diagram now have instance names in addition
      to class names).
      Corrected directory structure so Devel modules deploy correctly.
      Expanded samples README to explain that method and function are
      interchangeable so far as the modules are concerned.
      Cleaned test directory.

      Changed t/02perl.t and t/03perl.t so they ignore the first line of the
      sequence outline.  On some Perls (including a 5.8 on Solaris 2.4)
      the first line is '    (eval)' instead of 'main'.  I think the effect
      on the pictures will be minor: (eval) will replace main as the label
      for the left most class box (but I could be wrong).

      Modified Makefile.PL so the shebang line will be right more often.

      Added output to failing tests so I have a better chance to see what
      is wrong on someone else's box.

0.02  Fri Feb 28 08:06:52 CST 2003
      Introduced UML::Sequence::PerlOOSeq and modified UML::Sequence::JavaSeq
      so these no longer conflate distinct instances onto the same life line

      Added samples directory with instructions for making them.
