Revision history for Perl extension UML::Sequence.

0.08 Tue Sep 11 17:08:45 CDT 2007
    - Corrected test suite so tests needing to shell out call $^X to get
      their perl instead of getting the firt perl in the path.
      Thanks to Andreas Koenig for finding this problem.

0.07 Fri Sep  8 17:42:58 CDT 2006
    - Corrected error that disallowed array ref returns from grab_methods.
      That caused the PerlSeq and PerlOOSeq backends to fail, since that's
      what they choose to return.  Thanks to CPAN user NKH for pointing
      this out with enough detail for me to fix it.

0.06	Tue Jan 31 2006 (D. Arnold)
	- significat updates to UML::Sequence::SimpleSeq:
		- '*' iterator indicator
		- '->' async event intro indicator; renders as halfarrow
		- '!' urgent indicator (for PSiCHE/Thread::Apartment)
		- '[text]' conditional indicator
		- '/*' annotation '*/' support
		- 'class.method -> returns' syntax

	- updated genericseq.source to add grab_methods() ref to 
		build_xml_sequence() params

	- updated UML::Sequence::Svg:
		- added '-[pP] pathname' option to specify classdocs path; 
			renders as hyperlinks for classnames and methods
		- added '-c color' to render color of class boxes
		- added '-a color' to render color of activation boxes
		- added rendering of return arrows
		- changed arrow label positions to cuddle arrowheads
		- slightly increased arrowhead size
		- added -x charWidth, -y charHeight options to specify text sizes
		- added text wrapping for class names to fit class boxes
		- added -g arrow-gap option to adjust inter-arrow spacing
		- added -[mM] html-file imagemap option
		- added -w classBoxWidth option to adjust spacing of class boxes
		- added -e option to render ordered list of annotations
			after imagemap, and append superscript w/ hyperlinks
			to the annotation to the arrow labels
		- added -j option to render annotations as Javascript'ed
			tooltips in the imagemap links

	- added deluxewash samples
	- added 07deluxe.t, 08edeluxesvg.t, 09jdeluxe.t, 10raster.t to tests
	- added UML::Sequence::Raster.pm, which renders a raster image
		of the diagram using GD/GD::Text
	- removed "EDIT HISTORY" sections from all modules

      Corrected NAME entry in pod for genericseq.source so that html links
      on CPAN are not broken for it.
      Corrected t/03java.t to reflect the new instance oriented approach
      (boxes at the top of the diagram now have instance names in addition
      to class names).
      Corrected directory structure so Devel modules deploy correctly.
      Expanded samples README to explain that method and function are
      interchangeable so far as the modules are concerned.
      Cleaned test directory.

      Changed t/02perl.t and t/03perl.t so they ignore the first line of the
      sequence outline.  On some Perls (including a 5.8 on Solaris 2.4)
      the first line is '    (eval)' instead of 'main'.  I think the effect
      on the pictures will be minor: (eval) will replace main as the label
      for the left most class box (but I could be wrong).

0.03  Mon Mar 10 13:41:26 CST 2003
      Modified Makefile.PL so the shebang line will be right more often.

      Added output to failing tests so I have a better chance to see what
      is wrong on someone else's box.

0.02  Fri Feb 28 08:06:52 CST 2003
      Introduced UML::Sequence::PerlOOSeq and modified UML::Sequence::JavaSeq
      so these no longer conflate distinct instances onto the same life line

      Added samples directory with instructions for making them.

0.01  Sat Jan 18 12:49:35 2003
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.20 with options
		-XA -n UML::Sequence
