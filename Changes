Revision history for Perl extension UML::Sequence.

0.01  Sat Jan 18 12:49:35 2003
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.20 with options
		-XA -n UML::Sequence

0.02  Fri Feb 28 08:06:52 CST 2003
      Introduced UML::Sequence::PerlOOSeq and modified UML::Sequence::JavaSeq
      so these no longer conflate distinct instances onto the same life line

      Added samples directory with instructions for making them.

0.03  Mon Mar 10 13:41:26 CST 2003
      Modified Makefile.PL so the shebang line will be right more often.

      Added output to failing tests so I have a better chance to see what
      is wrong on someone else's box.
